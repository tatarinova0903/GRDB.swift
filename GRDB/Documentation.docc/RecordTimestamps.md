# Record Timestamps and Transaction Date

Learn how applications can save creation and modification dates of records.

## Overview

Some applications want to record creation and modification dates of database records. This article provides some advice and sample code that you can adapt for your specific needs.

> Note: Creation and modification dates can be automatically handled by [SQLite triggers](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html). We'll explore a different technique, though.
>
> This is not an advice against triggers, and you won't feel hindered in any way if you prefer to use triggers. Still, consider:
>
> - A trigger does not suffer any exception, when some applications eventually want to fine-tune timestamps, or to perform migrations without touching timestamps.
> - The current time, according to SQLite, is not guaranteed to be constant in a given transaction. This may create undesired timestamp variations. We'll see below how GRDB provides a date that is constant at any point during a transaction.
> - The current time, according to SQLite, can't be controlled in tests and previews.

We'll start from this table and record type:

```swift
try db.create(table: "player") { t in
    t.autoIncrementedPrimaryKey("id")
    t.column("creationDate", .datetime).notNull()
    t.column("modificationDate", .datetime).notNull()
    t.column("name", .text).notNull()
    t.column("score", .integer).notNull()
}

struct Player {
    var id: Int64?
    var creationDate: Date?
    var modificationDate: Date?
    var name: String
    var score: Int
}
```

See how the table has non-null dates, while the record has optional dates.

This is because we intend, in this article, to timestamp actual database operations. The `creationDate` property is the date of database insertion, and `modificationDate` is the date of last modification in the database. A new `Player` instance has no meaningful timestamp until it is saved, and this absence of information is represented with `nil`:

```swift
// A new player has no timestamps.
var player = Player(id: nil, name: "Arthur", score: 1000)
player.id               // nil, because never saved
player.creationDate     // nil, because never saved
player.modificationDate // nil, because never saved

// After insertion, the player has timestamps.
try dbQueue.write { db in
    try player.insert(db)
}
player.id               // not nil
player.creationDate     // not nil
player.modificationDate // not nil
```

In the rest of the article, we'll address insertion first, then updates, and see a way to avoid those optional timestamps. The article ends with a sample protocol that your app may adapt and reuse.

## Insertion Timestamp

On insertion, the `Player` record should get fresh `creationDate` and `modificationDate`. The ``MutablePersistableRecord`` protocol provides the necessary tooling, with the ``MutablePersistableRecord/willInsert(_:)-1xfwo`` persistence callback. Before insertion, the record sets both its `creationDate` and `modificationDate`:

```swift
extension Player: Encodable, MutablePersistableRecord {
    /// Sets both `creationDate` and `modificationDate` to the
    /// transaction date, if they are not set yet.
    mutating func willInsert(_ db: Database) throws {
        if creationDate == nil {
            creationDate = try db.transactionDate
        }
        if modificationDate == nil {
            modificationDate = try db.transactionDate
        }
    }
    
    /// Update auto-incremented id upon successful insertion
    mutating func didInsert(_ inserted: InsertionSuccess) {
        id = inserted.rowID
    }
}

try dbQueue.write { db in
    // An inserted record has both a creation and a modification date.
    var player = Player(name: "Arthur", score: 1000)
    try player.insert(db)
    player.creationDate     // not nil
    player.modificationDate // not nil
}
```

The `willInsert` callback uses the ``Database/transactionDate`` instead of `Date()`. This has two advantages:

- Within a write transaction, all inserted players get the same timestamp:
    
    ```swift
    // All players have the same timestamp.
    try dbQueue.write { db in
        for var player in players {
            try player.insert(db)
        }
    }
    ```
    
- The transaction date can be configured with ``Configuration/transactionClock``, so that your tests and previews can control the date.

## Modification Timestamp

Let's now deal with updates. The `update` persistence method won't automatically bump the timestamp as the `insert` method does. We have to explicitly deal with the modification date:

```swift
// Increment the player score (two different ways).
try dbQueue.write { db in
    var player: Player
    
    // Update all columns
    player.score += 1
    player.modificationDate = try db.transactionDate
    try player.update(db)

    // Alternatively, update only the modified columns
    try player.updateChanges(db) {
         $0.score += 1
         $0.modificationDate = try db.transactionDate
    }
}
```

Again, we use ``Database/transactionDate``, so that all modified players get the same timestamp within a given write transaction.

> Note: The insertion case could profit from automatic initialization of the creation date with the ``MutablePersistableRecord/willInsert(_:)-1xfwo`` persistence callback, but the modification date is not handled with ``MutablePersistableRecord/willUpdate(_:columns:)-3oko4``. Instead, the above sample code explicitly modifies the modification date.
>
> This may look like an inconvenience, but there are several reasons for this:
>
> 1. The persistence methods that update are not mutating methods. `willUpdate` can not modify the modification date.
>
> 2. Automatic changes to the modification date from the general `update` method create problems.
>
>     Developers are seduced by this convenient-looking feature, but they also eventually want to disable automatic timestamp updates in specific circumstances. That's because application requirements happen to change, and developers happen to overlook some corner cases.
>
>     This need is well acknowledged by existing database libraries: to disable automatic timestamp updates, [ActiveRecord](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/861448/is-there-a-way-to-avoid-automatically-updating-rails-timestamp-fields) uses globals (not thread-safe in a Swift application), [Django ORM](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7499767/temporarily-disable-auto-now-auto-now-add) does not make it easy, and [Fluent](https://github.com/vapor/fluent-kit/issues/355) simply does not allow it.
>
>     None of those solutions or lack thereof are seducing.
>
> 3. Not all applications need one modification timestamp. For example, some need one timestamp per property, or per group of properties.
>
> By not providing automatic timestamp updates, all GRDB-powered applications are treated equally: they explicitly bump their modification timestamps when needed. Apps can help themselves by introducing protocols dedicated to their particular handling of updates. For an example of such a protocol, see <doc:RecordTimestamps#Sample-code-TimestampedRecord> below.

## Dealing with Optional Timestamps

When you fetch timestamped records from the database, it may be inconvenient to deal with optional dates, even though the database columns are guaranteed to be not null:

```swift
let player = try dbQueue.read { db 
    try Player.find(db, key: 1)
}
player.creationDate     // optional ðŸ˜•
player.modificationDate // optional ðŸ˜•
```

A possible technique is to define two record types: one that deals with players in general (optional timestamps), and one that only deals with persisted players (non-optional dates): 

```swift
/// `Player` deals with unsaved players
struct Player {
    var id: Int64?              // optional
    var creationDate: Date?     // optional
    var modificationDate: Date? // optional
    var name: String
    var score: Int
}

extension Player: Encodable, MutablePersistableRecord {
    /// Updates auto-incremented id upon successful insertion
    mutating func didInsert(_ inserted: InsertionSuccess) {
        id = inserted.rowID
    }
    
    /// Sets both `creationDate` and `modificationDate` to the
    /// transaction date, if they are not set yet.
    mutating func willInsert(_ db: Database) throws {
        if creationDate == nil {
            creationDate = try db.transactionDate
        }
        if modificationDate == nil {
            modificationDate = try db.transactionDate
        }
    }
}

/// `PersistedPlayer` deals with persisted players
struct PersistedPlayer: Identifiable {
    let id: Int64              // not optional
    let creationDate: Date     // not optional
    var modificationDate: Date // not optional
    var name: String
    var score: Int
}

extension PersistedPlayer: Codable, FetchableRecord, PersistableRecord {
    static var databaseTableName: String { "player" }
}
```

Usage:

```swift
// Fetch
try dbQueue.read { db 
    let persistedPlayer = try PersistedPlayer.find(db, id: 1)
    persistedPlayer.creationDate     // not optional
    persistedPlayer.modificationDate // not optional
}

// Insert
try dbQueue.write { db in
    var player = Player(id: nil, name: "Arthur", score: 1000)
    player.id               // nil
    player.creationDate     // nil
    player.modificationDate // nil
    
    let persistedPlayer = try player.insertAndFetch(db, as: PersistedPlayer.self)
    persistedPlayer.id               // not optional
    persistedPlayer.creationDate     // not optional
    persistedPlayer.modificationDate // not optional
}
```

See ``MutablePersistableRecord/insertAndFetch(_:onConflict:as:)`` and related methods for more information.

## Sample code: TimestampedRecord

This section provides a sample protocol for records that track their creation and modification dates.

You can copy it in your application, or use it as an inspiration. Not all apps have the same needs regarding timestamps!

`TimestampedRecord` provides the following features and methods:

- Use it as a replacement for `MutablePersistableRecord` (even if your record does not use an auto-incremented primary key):

    ```swift
    // The base Player type
    struct Player {
        var id: Int64?
        var creationDate: Date?
        var modificationDate: Date?
        var name: String
        var score: Int
    }

    // Add database powers (read, write, timestamps)
    extension Player: Codable, TimestampedRecord, FetchableRecord {
        /// Update auto-incremented id upon successful insertion
        mutating func didInsert(_ inserted: InsertionSuccess) {
            id = inserted.rowID
        }
    }
    ```

- Timestamps are set on insertion:

    ```swift
    try dbQueue.write { db in
        // An inserted record has both a creation and a modification date.
        var player = Player(name: "Arthur", score: 1000)
        try player.insert(db)
        player.creationDate     // not nil
        player.modificationDate // not nil
    }
    ```

- `updateWithTimestamp()` behaves like ``MutablePersistableRecord/update(_:onConflict:)``, but it also bumps the modification date.
    
    ```swift
    // Bump the modification date and update all columns in the database.
    player.score += 1
    try player.updateWithTimestamp(db)
    ```

- `updateChangesWithTimestamp()` behaves like ``MutablePersistableRecord/updateChanges(_:onConflict:modify:)``, but it also bumps the modification date if the record is modified.

    ```swift
    // Only bump the modification date if record is changed, and only
    // update the changed columns.
    try player.updateChangesWithTimestamp(db) {
        $0.score = 1000
    }

    // Prefer updateChanges() if the modification date should always be
    // updated, even if other columns are not changed.
    try player.updateChanges(db) {
        $0.score = 1000
        $0.modificationDate = try db.transactionDate
    }
    ```

- `touch()` only updates the modification date in the database, just like the `touch` unix command.
    
    ```swift
    // Only update the modification date in the database.
    try player.touch(db)
    ```

- There is no `TimestampedRecord.saveWithTimestamp()` method that would insert or update, like ``MutablePersistableRecord/save(_:onConflict:)``. You are encouraged to write instead (and maybe extend your version of `TimestampedRecord` so that it supports this pattern):
    
    ```swift
    extension Player {
        /// If the player has a non-nil primary key and a matching row in
        /// the database, the player is updated. Otherwise, it is inserted.
        mutating func saveWithTimestamp(_ db: Database) throws {
            // Test the presence of id first, so that we don't perform an
            // update that would surely throw RecordError.recordNotFound.
            if id == nil {
                try insert(db)
            } else {
                do {
                    try updateWithTimestamp(db)
                } catch RecordError.recordNotFound {
                    // Primary key is set, but no row was updated.
                    try insert(db)
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

The full implementation of `TimestampedRecord` follows:

```swift
/// A record type that tracks its creation and modification dates. See
/// <https://swiftpackageindex.com/groue/grdb.swift/documentation/grdb/recordtimestamps>
protocol TimestampedRecord: MutablePersistableRecord {
    var creationDate: Date? { get set }
    var modificationDate: Date? { get set }
}

extension TimestampedRecord {
    /// By default, `TimestampedRecord` types set `creationDate` and
    /// `modificationDate` to the transaction date, if they are nil,
    /// before insertion.
    ///
    /// `TimestampedRecord` types that customize the `willInsert`
    /// persistence callback should call `initializeTimestamps` from
    /// their implementation.
    mutating func willInsert(_ db: Database) throws {
        try initializeTimestamps(db)
    }
    
    /// Sets `creationDate` and `modificationDate` to the transaction date,
    /// if they are nil.
    ///

    /// this callback, call `initializeTimestamps` from your implementation.

        if creationDate == nil {

        }

            modificationDate = try db.transactionDate
        }
    }
    
    /// Sets `modificationDate`, and executes an `UPDATE` statement
    /// on all columns.
    ///

    ///   transaction date is used.
    mutating func updateWithTimestamp(_ db: Database, modificationDate: Date? = nil) throws {
        self.modificationDate = try modificationDate ?? db.transactionDate
        try update(db)
    }
    
    /// Modifies the record according to the provided `modify` closure, and,
    /// if and only if the record was modified, sets `modificationDate` and
    /// executes an `UPDATE` statement that updates the modified columns.
    ///

    ///     }
    ///     if modified {

    ///     - db: A database connection.
    ///     - modificationDate: The modification date. If nil, the
    ///       transaction date is used.
    ///     - modify: A closure that modifies the record.
